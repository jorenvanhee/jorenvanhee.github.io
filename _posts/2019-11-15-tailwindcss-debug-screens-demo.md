This is a demonstration of the [Tailwind CSS Debug Screens](https://github.com/jorenvanhee/tailwindcss-debug-screens) plugin. You can find the component provided by the plugin at the bottom left corner of the window. Resize your window and see how it displays the currently active screen (responsive breakpoint).
